# object-detection
This project is a Python-based object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. It detects and identifies objects in real-time video or from video files.

Features

Real-Time Object Detection: Leverages the pre-trained YOLOv3 model for high-speed and accurate detection.

Bounding Boxes: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects with labels and confidence scores.

Customizable: Adjust confidence thresholds, non-maximum suppression (NMS) settings, and detection parameters easily.
